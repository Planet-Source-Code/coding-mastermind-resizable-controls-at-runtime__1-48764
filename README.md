## Resizable Controls at Runtime

### Description

This code implements a module I have written that allows nearly ANY control to be resized at run-time. This would be handy for something like dynamic form design or something of that liking. I am not sure if anyone else has ever done this on PSC before and if they have, I am sorry. In this example I have implemented the module on 9 controls (can be used on many more, I just don't have the time). I am sorry that the screenshot is black and white, though it saved in the wrong format. I hope this helps.
